Goal: aim to make a front end that works well with Ollama LLMs. I want to be able to download LLM models from Ollama and have a good looking front that emulate ChatGPT

Start the application:
`docker compose build; docker compose up`

TODO:
1. Change chat bubbles to emulate chatGPT
2. Change chat to Markdown style and get the model to return responses in Markdown
3. Ensure send button doesn't move when conversation goes over a few turns
4. Work on aesthetics
5. Have a chat side bar
