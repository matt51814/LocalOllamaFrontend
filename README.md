Goal: aim to make a front end that works well with Ollama LLMs. I want to be able to download LLM models from Ollama and have a good looking front that emulate ChatGPT


TODO:
1. Make Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
2. Create docker-compose.yml file that can be used to start whole application
3. Make conversation history available to the model
4. Work on aesthetics
