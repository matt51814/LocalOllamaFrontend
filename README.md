Goal: aim to make a front end that works well with Ollama LLMs. I want to be able to download LLM models from Ollama and have a good looking front that emulate ChatGPT


TODO:
1. Create docker-compose.yml file that can be used to start whole application
2. Make conversation history available to the model
3. Work on aesthetics
